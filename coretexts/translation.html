<div class="ctIntro" id="translation">
    <p>Translations of The Book of Plague began in the year 2000, about 30 years after the creation of the original text. Conceived asexually and written in the year 1970, the creators of BOP (no, not the hit song by DaBaby) were coked up and drunk on homemade moonshine they’d trafficked out of Alabama after journeying there from Manhattan on one particularly bad bender they prefer you didn’t talk about, thank you very much. As such, the words written required a few minutes of meticulous translation which was achieved only through the collaboration of biblical scholars, David Letterman, and a group of NYU misfits who stupidly thought majoring in film would be a good use of their time.
