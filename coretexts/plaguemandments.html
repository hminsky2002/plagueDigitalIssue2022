  <p>

    1. You shall not share your password for the various streaming services. They actually lose a lot of money this way which is ultimately just detrimental to you, the consumer.
    <br>
    <br>
    2. You shall stop making fun of the Metaverse and NFTs. They’re actually a really neat, useful technology and you making fun of it is a defense mechanism to hide the fact that you’re lonely and stupid.
    <br>
    <br>
    3. You shall not steal, unless you want it sooooo so bad, like for example if the thing in question is
    new Nintendo Switch.
    <br>
    <br>

    5.    You shall realize that you can’t breathe through your nose if you have your tongue stuck out at the
    same time.
    <br>
    <br>

    6.    You shall realize that you just tried number 5 and realized that it actually is possible.
    <br>
    <br>

    7.    You shall smile right now, because you were fooled.
    <br>
    <br>

    8.    You shall realize that you skipped number 4.
    <br>
    <br>

    9.    You just checked to see if there even is a number 4 (there isn’t).
    <br>
    <br>

    10.    You shall contribute no less than 60% of your last paycheck and/or one or both of your kidneys to
    the nearest Plaguechurch.
