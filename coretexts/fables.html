  Once upon a time, in a land very much like our own, there was a man named Christopher. Only, he wasn’t a man. He was a horse. And, to be perfectly frank, nobody called him Christopher. But, then again, nobody bothered to ask.
  <br>
  <br>

  One day Christopher was out grazing in the fields when he happened upon a peasant gleaning the remnants of the harvest. He was a sturdy chap of four and twenty with strapping shoulders and a pockmarked face. Christopher came closer, and the peasant noticed him.
  <br>
  <br>

  “Don’t mind me,” the peasant said. “I’ve only come to take what I need. No more, no less.”
  <br>
  <br>

  This puzzled Christopher, namely because he didn’t speak English. He was a horse. It was rather like how you, dear reader, would feel speaking to an animal of another species: for instance, a goldfish, or an Italian.
  <br>
  <br>

  On the next day, Christopher found himself in the same spot of the same field. And, lo and behold, the same peasant returned.
  <br>
  <br>

  “I see the look you give me, horse, but come closer and listen to my many troubles. My family has nothing to eat, so I take what I can find in these fields. My son has the plague, but we can’t afford medicine. And I don’t really believe in vaccines anyway. My wife needs a glass eye, but we’re too poor to afford glass, so we’ve just filled the little hole in with dirt. All this and winter is upon us. If only I could find some way to last us through the cold!”
  <br>
  <br>

  “Neigh,” said Christopher.
  <br>
  <br>

  On the third day, Christopher returned to the field, but did not see the peasant at first. Then, suddenly he appeared, with a young wife and a boy of seven in tow.
  <br>
  <br>

  “These, horse, are my family. We may not have much, but what we do have is each other’s love… And a dose of horse tranquilizer.”
  <br>
  <br>

  And before he knew it, Christopher had been drugged, dragged, chopped up and pickled in several large barrels. The peasant’s family made it through the winter.
