    Dear Diary,
    <br>
    <br>
    Today is the 31st of May. It is a very special day, as we here at the Plague have been preparing a spell to ward off June and replace it in its entirety with May 32nd through 61st. Some of us have raised concerns, but the Elders have promised us that this is not being done in an attempt to erase Pride Month. They just really like May and want it to be extra long. Makes sense to me. Still, my birthday is supposed to be tomorrow, but since June 1st won’t exist, I’m not allowed to celebrate, and I’m being told that I will have to remain 17 years old forever. Oh well. I live to serve Plague Jesus.

    Dear Diary,
    <br>
    <br>
    Today is the 32nd of May. The spell worked! June no longer exists, and I am still not allowed to vote in federal elections.
