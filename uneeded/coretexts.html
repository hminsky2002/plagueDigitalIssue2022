                <div class="content">
                    <p>
                    Translations of The Book of Plague began in the year 2000, about 30 years
                        after the creation of the original text. Conceived asexually and written in the year 1970,
                        the creators of BOP (no, not the hit song by DaBaby) were coked up and drunk on homemade moonshine
                        they’d trafficked out of Alabama after journeying there from Manhattan on one
                        particularly bad bender they prefer you didn’t talk about,
                        thank you very much. As such, the words written required a few minutes of
                        meticulous translation which was achieved only through the collaboration of
                        biblical scholars, David Letterman, and a group of NYU misfits who stupidly
                        thought majoring in film would be a good use of their time.

                <h1>Origin Myth 1</h1>
                <p>Before time began, when oceans were but a whisper of a dream and mountains no more than wisps of memories of thoughts, there was—and hear me out—there was this, uh, this guy named Kevin. Which, I don’t know, maybe that sounds kind of stupid to you, but riddle me this: what the hell kind of name is God anyway? Or Jesus? Kevin is a much more normal, people-pleasing name, and he also happens to be the divine being who molded our universe so yeah, who looks stupid now, YOU do.

                    Anyways, Kevin was very wise. He believed in special things like making sure that different ethnic groups don’t mix—okay! I hear your little alarm bells going off, but might I remind you that he grew up in a really small town where there weren’t a lot of minorities, so we should honestly just be grateful that he wasn’t even more racist.

                    Kevin believed in special things like making sure that different ethnic groups don’t mix. It’s not that he “hated minorities” or anything, he just thought, you know, like, there’s a reason fish stay in the ocean and giraffes stay on the land, you know?

                    I’m sensing this is controversial, so I’m going to move onto Kevin’s other teachings.

            <h1>Origin Myth 1 Cont</h1>
                <p> Kevin did not think much of women—

                    Oh my God, like other religions are perfect! Kevin did not think much of women, but he wasn’t an incel. He wasn’t an incel. He chose to not have sex because he was doing other, more important things like molding our universe. See those stars in the sky? Women didn’t put those there, Kevin did. Thank you, Kevin.

                    I’m sensing some disgruntlement. Kevin knew that this would happen. He knew that the truth would be hard for people to swallow. And therein lies Kevin’s most important teaching, even more important than different ethnic groups shouldn’t mix and you should not think much about women.

                    Kevin’s most important teaching is this:

                    Thou shalt not listen to the opinions of others. Thou shalt find the light that shines from within you, and follow it as your waypoint. Thou shalt ignore things like facts and data, things that shroud your opinion, which hopefully is that different ethnic groups shouldn’t mix and there is not much to women. Thou shalt listen to yourself and Kevin, for you are Kevin and Kevin is you.

                    Kevin’s most ardent desire was for this tenet to sweep through the world, touching everyone, spreading from person to person. Rapid and true. Untainted, harmonic, elegant. And above all, virulent.

                    Kevin called this idea The Plague.</p>

                <p>
                    1.  You shall not share your password for the various streaming services. They actually lose a lot of money this way which is ultimately just detrimental to you, the consumer.
                    2.  You shall stop making fun of the Metaverse and NFTs. They’re actually a really neat, useful technology and you making fun of it is a defense mechanism to hide the fact that you’re lonely and stupid.
                    3.  You shall not steal, unless you want it sooooo so bad, like for example if the thing in question is
                    new Nintendo Switch.
                    5.    You shall realize that you can’t breathe through your nose if you have your tongue stuck out at the
                    same time.
                    6.    You shall realize that you just tried number 5 and realized that it actually is possible.
                    7.    You shall smile right now, because you were fooled.
                    8.    You shall realize that you skipped number 4.
                    9.    You just checked to see if there even is a number 4 (there isn’t).
                    10.    You shall contribute no less than 60% of your last paycheck and/or one or both of your kidneys to
                    the nearest Plaguechurch.

                <h1>From the Book Of Pennesis</h1>
                <p>
                    There was once a poor farmer named Rigatoni who prayed to the Lord God for something to eat. And because the Lord was in a good mood that day he appeared before Rigatoni and said, “take this wheat-based dough and mold it according to your image. Boil it in the streams of waters and deliver it to my children throughout the world as a gift.” And so Rigatoni molded the dough into little tubes and delivered the Lord’s gift to the people of the world. The people lauded Rigatoni for his gift and asked him its name. And Rigatoni looked out at the people and shouted: “Rigatoni!”
                    The Lord was very unhappy with Rigatoni’s betrayal, and so the Lord went to a second poor farmer, Tortellini, and said to him, “take this wheat-based dough and mold it according to your image. Boil it in the steamiest of waters and deliver it to my children as a gift.” And so Tortellini molded the dough into tiny amorphous blobs, filled them with cheese for no particular reason, and delivered the Lord’s gift to the people of the world. The people lauded Tortellini for his gift and asked him its name. And Tortellini looked out at the people and shouted: “Tortellini!”
                    This angered the Lord the most, for having your intellectual property stolen by a man named Tortellini is quite the blow to your self-esteem. And so the Lord went to dozens of poor farmers and gave them each wheat-based dough to mold, boil, and deliver to the people of the world. And each time when asked the name of the delicacy, each farmer gave their own name: “Stromboli!” “Lasagna!” “Cavatelli!”
                    And so the Lord appeared before the world and said unto them: “I am your Lord God, and I created this wheat-based delicacy that you crave so much!” And Rigatoni asked what it was called. And the Lord responded: “Impasta!” And his children mistook their Lord’s agitation for the name of the delicacy, and that is why today it is known as pasta. And for a final punishment, the Lord God made his creation disgusting and borderline uneatable without the use of a sauce. And that is why only weirdos eat plain pasta.

                    And so, for Scroto, the heavens wept. Dedicated in life to the pursuit of joy and laughter, truly the saint of Silly, Scroto had come to a breaking point in his holy mission. At a kickback of saints and priests, Scroto had violated the word of thy god in heaven and told a joke at the expense of Bishop Gregory IV, known as Gregory the fat-necked.
                    Thus spoke Scroto:
                    “I’m the typa guy to spend four or five minutes putting on my holy necklace, but believe me when I say, Gregory, your neck is fat as fuck!”
                    A sinful silence permeated the room and Scroto felt the weight of his sins crawling on his spine. In his pursuit to be the “silliest guy” he had instead alienated the parish, spitting on his destiny and making Gregory weep ugly tears.
                    God wept, for Scroto was to be chief in the holy council, his silly rabbit. But without the support of his fellow clergymen Scroto was doomed to obscurity and head lice.
                    Scroto returned to his hovel, a modest hut made of bone and cedar, and prayed for forgiveness from the almighty
                    Scroto spoke:
                    “Lord, thy power in heaven who bequeefs us with spirit, be there any way for me to remedy my misdeeds, to redeem poor scroto in the eyes of thou”
                    God replied:
                    “Scroto, my son. My Child. My offspring. My Lad. My boy. My big boy. My big strong boy man. Scroto, you must not ask for forgiveness from me, but from thee who thou have offended.”
                    And Scroto said:
                    “God, Gregory is pissed and will probably kill me”
                    God said:
                    “I have spoken.”
                    And so Scroto mulled on these words, repeated them to himself until meaning was yielded like the peanut is yielded from the peanut shell. Yield Scroto did, for at the next kickback he spoke
                    Thusly:
                    “Friends, holy men, I come bearing apologies for my big silly fuckup from last week.”
                    He was met with ill will but pressed
                    “I bring a new tenant, one from god, you know, god? Yeah. No longer ought we to wear our tight holy necklaces that squeeze our throats. Instead, witness!”
                    And so Scroto revealed his great invention: a necklace so big and so wide that no neck, no matter how grotesquely large, would have trouble squeezing in.
                    “Hooray! Scroto! Hooray for Scroto!”
                    Rang cheers in the room, and God smiled upon the clergy, manifesting giant necklaces for all. And so we wear our necklaces that dangle down to our groins and slap our genitals in the wind to this day.

                <h1>Account Of Heaven And Earth</h1>
                <p>
                    This is the account of the heavens and the earth when they were created, when the Lord Plague God made the earth and the heavens.

                    Now no shrub had appeared upon the ground, nor plant sprung from the earth. Oceans were naught but desolate basins of dry, brittle dirt and the skies were naked of stars.

                    Watching this unformed land as the aeons passed, the Lord Plague God grew tired. He knew that there was potential hitherto untapped, and stronger did the ache to access it grow. This Great Desire consumed Him, and Plague God set out to work.

                    Plague God gathered the heavy metals from below the earth’s crust, heating them until they flowed like river water, poured them into molds fashioned with sweat and blood by His own hands—and at last calcified them into what we know today… as bitcoin.

                    Plague God’s divinity was hewn from many things; His kindness, His patience—but above all, His wiles. And it was those wiles that told Him, in an age before all ages, that He should really get a head start on crypto, it’s totally gonna be HUGE.

                    So Plague God said, Let there be bitcoin: and there was bitcoin. And Plague God saw bitcoin, and it was good.

                    But bitcoin was lonely on the earth. As the first peer-to-peer open source cryptocurrency, a class of digital assets created using cryptographic techniques and also Plague God that conveniently enables people to buy, sell or trade them securely (wow!), its existence was a solitary one. So Plague God created dogecoin.

                    Bitcoin and dogecoin enjoyed a merry union. They lived in a garden, which Plague God called the Metaverse.

                    One day, Bitcoin grew hungry. It set out to find sustenance, but it came across a rather curious thing instead. It looked nothing like Bitcoin or Dogecoin, nothing at all. This was the first man, Elon.

                    Clutching Elon was a woman, called Hillary.

                    Hillary was dirty, her elbows caked in mud. Elon was handsome, his chest broad and gaze discerning.

                    Hillary seemed terrified, even disgusted by Bitcoin, but Elon was intrigued. He approached Bitcoin and, sharing Plague God’s wiles, saw in it a glorious purpose.

                    Wretched woman that she was, Hillary scrambled from Bitcoin. She was afraid of the opportunities it presented, including its Accessibility and Liquidity, failing to recognize that it granted users Anonymity and Total Transactional Transparency.

                    But Elon approached, unafraid. And in that very hour, he spoke: “The lament of Hillary has come to me. Perhaps she does not see the High Return Potential that Bitcoin presents, nor its flexibility under No Government Restriction.”

                    He greeted Bitcoin as an old friend, and beckoned Hillary to join.

                    But Hillary was cowardly and rejected it, even though it granted users Independence from Central Authority and had countless more unique advantages over the traditional banking system.

                    And so He condemned Hillary to hell, defeating the first Great Evil that our world has faced.

                    Elon, for choosing correctly, was rewarded handsomely. Plague God bequeathed unto him a little car that plugs into the wall like an iPhone, and 8 children whose names became increasingly abstract in direct proportion to how recently they were born.

                    Thus the heavens were completed in their vast array, and Plague God rested.
