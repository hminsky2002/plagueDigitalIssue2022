    <p>Today, November 16th, 2022, I, Dr. Hamburglar Billingsbee, the Chief Scientist of the Holy Church of Plague, discovered that the sun is actually the center of the universe. I know that for a while there, most people thought that Earth was actually the center of the universe, but those people are a bunch of big dumb dumbs.
    The sun is the center of the universe! That’s cuz there’s this thing called supersonic invisible yolo sauce that keeps the Earth and all the other planets in the solar system revolving around the sun.</p>
    <p>That’s what also keeps us firmly on the ground. Ever jump up and fall back down to the ground? Well, you have supersonic invisible yolo sauce to thank. I know a bunch of scientists thinks that it’s called gravity but it’s not. It’s called supersonic invisible yolo sauce.
    In conclusion, I am the greatest scientist in all of the world, as evidenced by how I discovered both the heliocentric nature of our cosmos as well as the supersonic invisible yolo sauce. I am genius.</p>
